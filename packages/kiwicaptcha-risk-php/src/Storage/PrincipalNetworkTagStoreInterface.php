/**
 * The principal first-seen network tag records. One record per
 * principal and tag. This mirrors the Rust PrincipalNetworkTagStore
 * trait and the canonical `principal_networks.lua` script.
 *
 * Normative contract:
 *
 *  - Tags: `net:<prefix_hex>`, `asn:<decimal>`, `session:<pseudonym_hex>`,
 *    `device:<pseudonym_hex>`. Each is a hash field whose value is the
 *    last-use ms from the storage clock (never a client clock).
 *  - Trust: a `t:` prefixed mirror field. Trust is minted only on an
 *    Allow or a completed step-up. A Deny path can never mint trust.
 *  - Caps (per principal, LRU by last-use): `session:` 32, `device:` 16,
 *    `net:` 64, `asn:` 64. The oldest entries above the cap are evicted
 *    with their trust flags.
 *  - TTLs: `session:` 2x the continuity cookie TTL (default 3600 s);
 *    `device:` the trusted-device TTL (default 90 days); `net:`/`asn:`
 *    400 days. A read past the class TTL answers "not seen".
 *  - Fail-closed errors: any storage failure throws
 *    {@see RiskStoreException}. The implementation never returns "not
 *    seen" on error (which would read as "novel" and price users out
 *    without a signal) and never "seen" (which would fail open).
 *
 * Production implementation:
 * {@see \KiwiCaptcha\Risk\Storage\RedisPrincipalNetworkTagStore}.
 * In-memory fixtures in tests are named fakes and never wired into the
 * container.
